# MissingNetEpi
This repo contains code files for a stochastic SIR model based on dynamic interaction of agents in a community, but allows a much reduced data format such that no granular interaction times are needed. Details of the methodology are available:xxx.

This work extends the original work of Fan Bu's at https://github.com/fanbu1995/CoEpiNet, which implements a similar stochastic SIR model but requires granular interaction history of agents.

## Things included
1. simulation codes (both SIR- and SIS-type) epidemic processes on adaptive networks
2. inference codes on complete data
3. inference codes on partially observed data w/ missing recovery times and agent interaction events
